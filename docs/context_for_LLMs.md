## Comment style
We have a very very minimalist comment style. Please only add comments of the following type to my code.
- Interface comments
    - Comment should describe overall abstraction offered by the class
    - What are the inputs
    - What are the outputs
- Data structure member (e.g. variable) comments
    - Describe the meaning of the variables in the module
