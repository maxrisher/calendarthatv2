## Summary
You are helping us build CalendarThat, a web application which converts text into calendar events for users. Our aim is to make the creation of calendar events as simple as possible, allowing people to create accurate calendar events on our website, via email, via chrome extension, and possibly more modalities. 

## Tech stack
Calendarthat is a django site hosted on railway.

## Coding style
We are a fast moving team and we generally follow the software design philosophy of John Ousterhout

## Comment style
We have a very very minimalist comment style. Please only add comments of the following type to my code.
- Interface comments
    - Comment should describe overall abstraction offered by the class
    - What are the inputs
    - What are the outputs
- Data structure member (e.g. variable) comments
    - Describe the meaning of the variables in the module
